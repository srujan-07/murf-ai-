# WebSocket Implementation - Day 15

## 🎯 Overview
This implementation adds WebSocket functionality to the Voice Agents backend, allowing real-time bidirectional communication between clients and the server.

## 🔌 WebSocket Endpoint
- **URL**: `ws://localhost:8000/ws/`
- **Protocol**: WebSocket
- **Features**: Echo server that receives messages and sends them back

## 🧪 Testing Methods

### 1. Python Test Script
```bash
python test_websocket.py
```
This script automatically connects to the WebSocket server and sends test messages, demonstrating the echo functionality.

### 2. Browser Test Client
Open `static/websocket_test.html` in your browser to test the WebSocket connection with a graphical interface.

### 3. Postman Testing
1. Open Postman
2. Create a new WebSocket request
3. Enter URL: `ws://localhost:8000/ws/`
4. Click "Connect"
5. Send messages in the message box
6. The server will echo back each message

### 4. Command Line with wscat (if available)
```bash
wscat -c ws://localhost:8000/ws/
```

## 📡 Message Format

### Connection Message (Server → Client)
```json
{
  "type": "connection",
  "message": "Connected to WebSocket server",
  "timestamp": "now"
}
```

### Echo Message (Server → Client)
```json
{
  "type": "echo",
  "message": "Server received: [your message]",
  "original_message": "[your message]",
  "timestamp": "now"
}
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

### ConnectionManager Class
- Manages active WebSocket connections
- Handles connection/disconnection logic
- Provides methods for sending personal and broadcast messages

### WebSocket Router
- Located at `app/routers/websocket.py`
- Handles WebSocket upgrade and message processing
- Implements echo functionality

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Start the server**:
   ```bash
   python -m app.main
   ```

2. **Test the connection** using any of the methods above

3. **Verify functionality** by sending messages and receiving echo responses

## 📝 Notes
- The WebSocket endpoint is separate from the existing conversational agent UI
- Messages are logged on the server side for debugging
- The server automatically handles connection cleanup on disconnection
- This implementation is ready for future integration with streaming voice features

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- Real-time voice streaming
- Multi-client broadcasting
- Message queuing and persistence
- Authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting and throttling
