# Day 16: Streaming Audio Recording with WebSockets

## 🎯 Challenge Objective
Record and stream audio data from the client to the server using WebSockets and save it to a file.

## ✨ What We Built
A real-time audio streaming system that:
- Records audio on the client side using the MediaRecorder API
- Streams audio chunks to the server via WebSocket connections
- Saves received audio data to files on the server in real-time
- Provides real-time feedback and statistics during recording

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Client Side (Frontend)
- **WebSocket Connection**: Establishes persistent connection to server
- **MediaRecorder**: Records audio with 100ms timeslice for streaming
- **Real-time Streaming**: Sends audio chunks immediately as they're recorded
- **Live Statistics**: Shows chunk count, bytes sent, and recording duration

### Server Side (Backend)
- **WebSocket Handler**: Receives both text messages and binary audio data
- **Audio Stream Management**: Tracks multiple concurrent audio streams
- **File I/O**: Creates and writes to audio files in real-time
- **Connection Tracking**: Manages unique connection IDs and stream states

## 🔧 Key Features

1. **Real-time Audio Streaming**
   - Audio chunks sent every 100ms during recording
   - No buffering or accumulation on client side
   - Immediate server-side file writing

2. **Connection Management**
   - Unique connection IDs for each WebSocket
   - Proper cleanup of file handles on disconnect
   - Automatic reconnection handling

3. **File Management**
   - Automatic uploads directory creation
   - Timestamped filenames with connection IDs
   - Real-time file writing with flush operations

4. **Live Feedback**
   - Connection status updates
   - Audio chunk confirmations
   - Recording statistics in real-time
   - Error handling and user notifications

## 📁 File Structure

```
app/routers/websocket.py          # Updated WebSocket handler
static/app_new.js                 # New client-side streaming logic
static/index.html                 # Updated UI for Day 16
test_streaming_websocket.py       # Test script for verification
DAY16_README.md                   # This documentation
```

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Start the Server**
   ```bash
   python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

2. **Open the Web Interface**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:8000`
   - The page will automatically connect to WebSocket

3. **Start Recording**
   - Click "Start Recording" button
   - Speak into your microphone
   - Watch real-time statistics and WebSocket messages

4. **Stop Recording**
   - Click "Stop Recording" button
   - Audio file is automatically saved to `uploads/` directory

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test script to verify WebSocket functionality:
```bash
python test_streaming_websocket.py
```

This will:
- Connect to WebSocket server
- Send start recording message
- Simulate audio chunks
- Send stop recording message
- Verify file creation

## 📊 Technical Details

### WebSocket Message Types
- `connection`: Initial connection with unique ID
- `start_recording`: Begin audio stream
- `stop_recording`: End audio stream
- `audio_chunk_confirmed`: Server confirms chunk receipt
- `audio_stream_started`: New audio file created
- `error`: Error notifications

### Audio Format
- **Codec**: WebM with Opus codec
- **Chunk Size**: 100ms intervals
- **File Extension**: `.webm`
- **Naming**: `streaming_audio_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_connectionID.webm`

### Performance Features
- **Real-time Processing**: No buffering delays
- **Memory Efficient**: Chunks processed immediately
- **Concurrent Streams**: Multiple users can record simultaneously
- **Automatic Cleanup**: File handles closed on disconnect

## 🔍 Monitoring & Debugging

### Client Console
- WebSocket connection status
- Audio chunk transmission logs
- Server response messages

### Server Logs
- Connection lifecycle events
- Audio chunk processing
- File I/O operations
- Error handling

### File System
- Check `uploads/` directory for saved files
- Verify file sizes match expected data
- Monitor file creation timestamps

## 🎉 Success Criteria Met

✅ **Client-side recording logic**: Built on existing MediaRecorder implementation  
✅ **WebSocket streaming**: Audio chunks sent at regular intervals  
✅ **Server-side handling**: Binary audio data received and processed  
✅ **File saving**: Audio data saved to files in real-time  
✅ **UI updates**: Real-time feedback and statistics display  
✅ **Breaking existing UI**: New streaming-focused interface  

## 🚀 Next Steps

This implementation provides a solid foundation for:
- **Real-time transcription**: Stream audio to STT services
- **Live processing**: Apply audio filters or effects in real-time
- **Multi-user support**: Handle multiple concurrent recordings
- **Audio analysis**: Real-time audio quality metrics
- **Streaming TTS**: Real-time text-to-speech responses
